# Social Network API 

## Description 
The goal of this project was to create a social media backend so that the CEO of a start-up social media company would have a solid foundation upon which to grow. This will make it possible to access the primary features of a social media platform right away and maintain track of people, their postings, and any user replies to those posts. Users can add one another as friends as well. All of this results in the ability to add, update, delete, and view theÂ features listed above.
